          <h3 id="headline">The Rise (and not really a Fall) of an otherworld creator</h3>
          <ul> 
            <p>(David Robert Jones; London, 1947 - 2016) Being well know, not only for his androginous and provocative style but his innovative working, 
            Bowie had a tendency for getting the best part of many other aesthetic styles, combining them into hypnotic characters who were always the best complement for his musical 
            creations.</p>

            <p>David Bowie began his career singing and playing the saxophone in small venues and also in high schools, with amateur musicians such as The Manish Boys, 
            David Jones & The King Bees or Lower Third. At the end of the 1960s he began recording his first singles, which would later be integrated into his first album, 
            <i>David Bowie</i> (1967). He was also interested in the theater, training as a mime and actor with Lindsay Kemp, an influence that would be noticed later in his 
            performances.</p>

            <p>Bowie's songs generated a futuristic, obsessive atmosphere, where he gave room for brief winks directed at American rock and developed deep and dense sequences through 
            which Orwellian characters paraded (Big Brother from George Orwell's novel <i>1984</i>), archetypes of a decadent modernity or characters that seem to have emerged from 
            the gothic genre. In Great Britain the critics to this last album were harsh, and Bowie decided to turn his career around, adopting a more sober image and introducing 
            disco music and soul as stylistic influences in his compositions. He launched into the US market with <i>Young Americans</i> (1975), an album that rose to the top of the 
            sales charts and featured the song <i>Fame</i>, written with former Beatles frontman John Lennon.</p>

            <p>His enormous success was favored by his works for the cinema industry. In 1986 he composed the soundtrack for <i>Labyrinth</i>, a film directed by Jim Henson and 
            produced by George Lucas, where he also played one of the leading roles. He already treasured an extensive career as an actor in previous films, such as <i>The Man Who 
            Fell To Earth</i> (1976, by Nicolas Roeg), <i>Gigol√≥</i> (1979, by David Hemmings), <i>The Hunger</i> (1983, by Tony Scott), <i>Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence</i> 
            (1983, by Nagisa Oshima) or <i>When Night Comes</i> (1985, by John Landis).</p>

            <p>After a period in which he worked with the band Tin Machine, Bowie resumed his solo career with <i>Black Tie White Nose</i> (1993). Married to the model 
            Iman Abdulmajid, he began a new and fruitful musical stage. With <i>Outline</i> (1995), Bowie transformed himself again (this time he would adopt the identity of a 
            detective in a futuristic city) and regained his prominence at the forefront of the rock scene. A serious heart surgery forced him to cancel his 2004 European tour, 
            and although he managed to recover from it, he did not perform live again. However, he continued his musical work in the studios, releasing new albums such as <i>The 
            Next Day</i> (2013) and <i>Black Star</i> (2016), whose release preceded his death by just two days.</p>
